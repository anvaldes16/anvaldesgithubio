    About Me! I think?
    <p class ="slap">
      Here's me; I energetic 'know-at-all' who just likes to make a 'scene'. I'm a founding student at <em>Alpha<br>
    Cindy Avitia</em> and tries to excell in the most diligent can a being do. I treat others the same I want to be treated<br>and give a "helping hand."
      While at it, I was born in California and like everything sweet and dank. Oh and, my<br>
      name is Tyrone, but most people call me "Antonio Valdes."

    <h2 id="party-boy">Party Or Nah?</h2>
    <p>I'm a person who's charasmatic and care-taking to others, and soft-spoken as well. 
    <br>
    Also I'm want to become a person who is in charge of my own responsibilities while keeping a fond time.<br> 
    I am very spontaneous in any situation; bad or good.<br>
